### Arduino library for Winbond Flash Memory Chips
<sup> Download the latest stable release (v2.6.0) from <a href = "https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/releases/latest">here</a>. Please report any bugs in issues.</sup>

This Arduino library is for use with Winbond serial flash memory chips. In its current form it supports identifying the flash chip and its various features; automatic address allocation and management; reading and writing bytes/chars/ints/longs/floats/Strings from and to various locations; reading and writing pages of bytes; continous reading/writing of data from/to arrays of bytes/chars; sector, block and chip erase; and powering down for low power operation.

- For details of the Winbond Flash chips compatible with this library please refer to the Excel spreadsheet in the Extras folder.

#### Compatibility

##### Arduino IDEs supported (actually tested with)
- IDE v1.5.x
- IDE v1.6.0-v1.6.5
- IDE v1.6.9-v1.6.12
- IDE v1.8.2

##### Boards

###### Completely supported
- Arduino Uno
- Arduino Leonardo
- Arduino Micro
- Arduino Fio
- Arduino Mega
- Arduino Due
- ESP8266 Boards (On the Arduino IDE)
- Simblee Boards (On the Arduino IDE)

###### In BETA
- ESP32 Boards (Tested on the Sparkfun ESP32 thing) The library is known to work with the ESP32 core as of the current commit <a href = "https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/tree/7d0968c10dc540709d69a28eab2457075c1e4fa8">7d0968c</a> on 16.04.2017. ```ESP32 support will remain in beta till the ESP32 core can be installed via the Arduino boards manager.```

#### Installation

##### Option 1
- Open the Arduino IDE.
- Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage libraries.
- Search for SPIFlash.
- Install the latest version.

##### Option 2
- Click on the 'Clone or download' button above the list of files on this <a href = "https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/tree/master"> page </a>.
- Select Download ZIP. A .zip file will download to your computer.
- Unzip the archive and rename resulting folder to 'SPIFlash'
- Move the folder to your libraries folder (~/sketches/libraries)

#### Usage

The library is called by declaring the```SPIFLASH flash(csPin)``` constructor where 'flash' can be replaced by a user constructor of choice and 'csPin' is the Chip Select pin for the flash module.
Make sure to include ```#include<SPI.H>``` when you include ```#include<SPIFlash.h>```.
Also make sure to include ```flash.begin(CHIPSIZE*)``` in ```void setup()```. This enables the library to detect the type of flash chip installed and load the right parameters.
<sub>* Optional</sub>

###### Notes on Address overflow and Error checking
- The library has Address overflow enabled by default - i.e. if the last address read/written from/to,  in any function, is 0xFFFFF then, the next address read/written from/to is 0x00000. This can be disabled by setting the optional last 'overflow' argument in the constructor to NOOVERFLOW - For eg. call the constructor  ```SPIFlash(csPin, NOOVERFLOW)```  instead of ```SPIFlash(csPin)```. (Address overflow only works for Read / Write functions. Erase functions erase only a set number of blocks/sectors irrespective of overflow.)
- All write functions have Error checking turned on by default - i.e. every byte written to the flash memory will be checked against the data stored on the Arduino. Users who require greater write speeds can disable this function by setting an optional last 'errorCheck' argument in any write function to NOERRCHK - For eg. call the function ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer, NOERRCHK)``` instead of ```writeByte(address, *data_buffer)```.

The library enables the following functions:
<hr>

##### Primary commands

###### begin(_chipsize*)
Must be called at the start in setup(). This function detects the type of chip being used and sets parameters accordingly. An optional CHIPSIZE parameter can be declared as an argument with this function. For supported CHIPSIZE values, please refer to the appropriate [wiki section](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/wiki/begin()) or look at defines.h .

###### setClock(clockSpeed)
Must be called straight after begin(). This function takes a 32-bit number as replacement for the default maximum clock speed (104MHz for Winbond NOR flash) thereby initiating future SPI transactions with the user-defined clock speed. Use with care.

###### error(_verbosity)
Returns the (8-bit) error code generated by the function called immediately before this is called. If the optional VERBOSE argument is used, a verbose troubleshooting report is printed to Serial. Refer to the [Error reporting](https://github.com/Marzogh/SPIFlash/wiki/Error-reporting) section the Wiki for further reference.

###### getMANID()
Returns the Manufacturer ID as a 16-bit value.

###### getJEDECID()
Returns the JEDEC ID as a 32-bit value.

###### getCapacity()
Returns the capacity in bytes as a 32-bit value.

###### getmaxPage()
Returns the maximum number of pages in the flash memory as a 32-bit value.

###### getAddress()
Gets the next available address for use. Has two variants:
* Takes the size of the data as an argument and returns a 32-bit address
* Takes a three variables, the size of the data and two other variables to return a page number value & an offset into.

All addresses in the in the sketch must be obtained via this function or not at all.
###### sizeofStr()
Use this function to find the size of a String to use as the argument in getAddress(size). Using size = sizeof(String) will cause the getAddress(size) function to fail.

size = sizeof(variable) can be used for all types of data but String objects.

###### How to get data off Flash memory via Serial
<sub>(Works only for Unix based Operating Systems)</sub>

 - Make sure you include code to let you dump entire flash memory/specific page's content to Serial (Refer to the code in the _TestFlash.h_ for details on how to do this)
 - Connect your Arduino board to the computer.
 - Open the Arduino IDE, the IDE's Serial Monitor, and an OSX POSIX terminal.
 - Type the following command into the terminal window. ```% tail -f /dev/tty.usbmodem1411 > FlashDump.txt``` Make sure to replace the _/dev/tty.usbmodem1411_ with the port your arduino is connected to. (You can find this in Tools --> Ports in Arduino IDE 1.6.x)
 - Then type the command to read all pages into the Serial console. If you use my code from the example file the command is ```read_all_pages```
 - Wait a few seconds before typing ```Ctrl+C``` to end the tail process
 - Check that you have actually recieved all the data by typing ```% cat FlashDump.txt```. This should output the entire textfile into your terminal window.
