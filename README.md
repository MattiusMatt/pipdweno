    Matt:
    Dave?
    (Knocking: Knock, knock, knock, knock, knock, knock)
    Do you wanna build a PipBoy?
    Come on lets go and play
    I hear the master is a bore
    Come out the door
    It's like you've gone away-
    We used to kill the mutants
    And now you're gone
    I wish you would tell me why!-
    ...
    Do you wanna build a PipBoy?
    ...
    It doesn't have to be a PipBoy.
    
    Dave:
    Go away, Matt
    
    Matt:
    Okay, bye...
    
    (Knocking)
    Do you wanna build a PipBoy?
    Or come and find some bears of fallout 4!
    I think some geekery is overdue
    I've started talking to
    the characters in Fallout 4-
    (Hang in there, Preston!)
    It gets a little lonely
    All these ghouls and raiders,
    
    Just shooting the b@#*%$Â£s dead-
    (Pow-Pow, Pow-Pow, Pow-Pow, Pow-Pow, Pow-Pow)
    
    (Orchestral, Super Mutants attack)
    
    Matt:
    (Knocking)
    Dave?
    Please, I know you're in there,
    Vault Dwellers are asking where you've been
    They say "have courage", and I'm trying to
    I'm right out here you screw, just let me in
    We only have 10 bottlecaps
    It's just you and me
    What the f#@k are we gonna doooooooo?
    
    Do you wanna build a PipBoy?

## Why?
I was googling around and came across a Raspberry Pi PipBoy! I thourght "How cool is that" and bourght my second Rasberry Pi with the intention of building a PipBoy out of it.
My new Pi arrived, a spangly new AdaFruit TFT shield and an electronics starter kit! Two electronics tutorials and some LEDs later (out of ten tutorials) I decided to install the RasPipBoy python source I'd seen in the article and within an hour I had a PipBoy....
That was way too boring and easy as someone had done all of the work for me!!! Also I'm a bit weird (in case you hadn't noticed) and I didnt like watching Linux boot before the PipBoy code ran!! So I watched some more YouTube (yay for YouTube... the source of all my power) and decided to build an actual PipBoy as authentic as I could!
